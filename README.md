# Gardeners Exchange

### A Web App for local, direct agricultural trade.

<a href="/README_kr.md"> [ 한국어 소개는 이쪽입니다! ] 👈</a> 

- Gardener's Exchange is a web application platform where locals can buy, sell or trade agricultural products locally grown in their backyards.

- For a convenient e-commerce experience, we implemented a login page, personal user profile page, item feed page, item upload page, etc.

This Web App was submitted as the final project for CS class SYS394 - Information Systems Design at Taylor University.

It was created by team alpha-4 (Caleb Belmont, Donghun Ha, Daniel Thomas, Joel Vastbinder), and all rights are reserved for the team.

Thank you, Dr. Thomas Nurkkala, the instructor of this course, for the teaching, guidance, and kind words.
